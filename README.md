# hello-world


Various editing bullshit. Hellow random people reading stuff. I have no fucking clue how to git. So....working on that. I'm watching South Park while doing this. Because I've got nothing else to have on the background. On episdoe 2. Pretty good stuff. By the way, how about that Amazon Prime Video? Does it not have the shittiest interface in human history?
